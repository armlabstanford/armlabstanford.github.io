# About and Join

## ARMLab Mission
The mission of the **A**ssistive **R**obotics and **M**anipulation **Lab** is to develop intelligent, assistive, collaborative robots that improve human life.

### Our Vision

We want to develop collaborative robots that extend the abilities of the human user by either performing a service task, working alongside the human collaborator or assisting through physical augmentation of the human user. Our goal is to develop robots that are not only capable and responsive, but also have the ability to anticipate the situational needs of the human user. We specialize in developing intelligent robotic systems that can perceive and model environments, humans and tasks and leverage these models to predict system processes and understand their assistive role.



## Joining the ARM Lab
### To join the ARM Lab

**Researchers must become a member of the Stanford community!**

- Undergraduate (backgrounds in Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, AeroAstro, and Electrical Engineering are common in selected students); research can be for academic credit during the school year and for a paid internship through available programs during the summer (see below - interning). Summer internships in the programs below are also open to students external to Stanford
- [Graduate](https://gradadmissions.stanford.edu/applying) (fee waiver [application](https://graddiversity.stanford.edu/graduate-fee-waivers)). Competitive applicants should have many of the following skills: a) machine learning experience (pytorch, experience implementing machine learning models) b) Coding experience (python/C++/Robot Operating System (ROS)/Unity and use of Linux OS), and preferably implementation experience on physical hardware c) Fabrication experience (CAD, mechatronics). I generally accept 1-2 Ph.D. students per year depending on funding. Students are encouraged to look for fellowships that support 2+ years (see below for examples).
- Postdoc Positions: Postdoc positions are on a rolling basis, please see this google form to submit an application: Using this google form . Potential postdocs are also encouraged to apply to internal Stanford funding such as PRISM. To be eligible, a potential postdoc must have completed their PhD within 3 years of when they would begin as aStanford postdoc (https://postdocs.stanford.edu/postdoc-admins/how-appoint-postdocs) 
- For Ph.D. prospective students, while it is not required, it is very attractive to have secured fellowships. Common ones are: 

- [NSF Graduate Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)
- [Stanford Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/)
- [GEM Fellowship](http://www.gemfellowship.org/students/gem-fellowship-program/)
- [Nasa Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunities (NSTGRO)](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/nstgro)
- [National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG)](http://ndseg.asee.org/about_ndseg)
- [P.D. Soros Fellowship](https://www.pdsoros.org/apply)
- [Ford Foundation Fellowship](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/index.htm)
- [Fulbright Fellowship](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/applicants/getting-started)
- [Hertz Foundation Graduate Fellowship](https://hertzfoundation.org/fellowships/fellowshipaward)

This is a primer, not an exhaustive list. Stanford also provides a primer list through the [VPGE office](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/funding-graduate-study/external-funding).

#### Interning in the ARM Lab
Undergraduates interested in interning with the ARM lab are encouraged to apply to Stanford internships programs and then contact [Professor Monroe Kennedy](https://profiles.stanford.edu/monroe-kennedy).  Below please find existing internship opportunties with the Stanford ME department, we hope to expand this list in the future. 

- [Stanford SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship) Program](https://engineering.stanford.edu/students-academics/equity-and-inclusion-initiatives/prospective-graduate-programs/summer) (Application deadline Feb 1st)
- [List of internship opportunities supported by the Stanford ME Department](https://me.stanford.edu/research-impact/student-research-opportunities)
- Internship through CS Department: [CURIS](https://curis.stanford.edu/summer/)
 

Sometimes there are summer internship positions for highschool students, and those interested should apply through the Stanford Robotics Center (March 31st deadline for summer internship): https://robotics.sites.stanford.edu/education
